                MAKE THE DOUGH
                Tip the flour into a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. 
                Add the yeast and sugar to one side of the bowl and the salt to the other. 
                Pour in the milk and start mixing either by hand or in the mixer until it 
                begins to come together. Add the egg yolks and the butter and continue to 
                mix into a dough. Knead for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic, 
                then return to the bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to prove for 1 hour, 
                or until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                ROLL THE DOUGH
                Preheat a grill to medium-high (or set up your spit roast over an open fire or barbecue)! 
                Scrape the dough out of the bowl and onto a floured surface. Roll the dough out into a thin 
                sheet and cut into long ribbons, then join two ribbons, pressing the dough together to create 
                one very long ribbon. Grease your metal tube (or foil wrapped cans) with a little oil or 
                butter. Spiral the dough from one end of your metal tube to the other, covering the metal 
                but not overlapping the dough. Gently roll the tube over a work surface press the dough 
                together a little. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and cocoa powder on a large plate and roll 
                the dough in it.
            </li>
            <li>
                COOK!
                Place the dough rings onto a baking tray and place them under the grill, turning 
                every minute for 10 minutes until theyâ€™re golden and crisp on the outside 
                (or attach the tubes to your spit roast and turn over the fire continuously 
                until golden brown and crisp on the outside).
            </li>
            <li>
                FINISH AND SERVE
                Leave the dough to cool a little, then slide them off the metal tubes to create 
                a hollow cylinder.
