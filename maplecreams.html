            <ul>
                
              <li>
                256g plain flour
              </li>
              <li>
                384g icing sugar, divided (128g and 256g)
              </li>
              <li>
                1/2 teaspoon salt
              </li>
              <li>
                1 1/2 teaspoons maple extract or vanilla
              </li>
              <li>
                340g unsalted butter, softened and cut into cubes, divided (227g and 113g)
              </li>
              <li>
                85g maple syrup
              </li>
              
              
              
             </ul>

                Method
        </div>
        <div class="content_section_text">
          
          <ol class="olset">
            
            <li>
                First, make the cookies: Heat oven to 170°C. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
                
            </li>
            <li>
                Add flour, 128g icing sugar and salt to a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine, 
                then add maple extract and 227g cubed butter. Pulse mixture until butter is incorporated 
                and mixture looks like wet sand and begins to climb up sides of bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer dough to a counter and gently press into a mound. The mixture will be loose and 
                crumbly, but knead it a few times until it comes together into a cohesive shape. Gently 
                form dough into a square. Sprinkle flour onto counter next to the dough; place dough on 
                top of floured surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a well-floured rolling pin, roll dough out to 6-7 mm thickness. Using a floured 
                2-inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into shapes (you can also use a different cookie 
                cutter shape or cut the dough into squares, if desired). Re-roll dough out 1-2 times 
                to cut out more shapes, if needed. You should end up with approximately 36-40 cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer cookies to one lined baking sheet. Place baking sheet in freezer and freeze 
                cookies for about 15 minutes or until cookies are firm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer some of the cookies to second lined baking sheet — as many as can fit spaced 
                1/2-inch apart (keep remaining cookies in freezer). Bake cookies 15 to 18 minutes 
                until baked through and edges are lightly golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool cookies 1-2 minutes on cookie sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool 
                completely. Repeat step 6 as needed until all cookies are baked.
            </li>
            <li>
                While cookies cool, make the maple buttercream frosting: In a large bowl using an 
                electric hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, 
                beat remaining 113g butter on medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in 
                remaining 256g powdered sugar until smooth. Beat in maple syrup. Increase speed
                 to medium-high and beat frosting 1-2 minutes or until fluffy and light.
            </li>
            <li>
                On a work surface, lay half of cooled cookies bottom side-up. Use a piping bag, 
                storage bag with one tip snipped off or a spatula to pipe or spread approximately 
                1 generous tablespoon frosting on cookies. Top with remaining cookies to form a sandwich.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature or refrigerated up to 4 days.
            </li>
            
            
              
          </ol>
