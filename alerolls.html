          <ol class="olset">
                
            <li>
                Place the dry ingredients in a bowl, taking care not to have the salt and 
                yeast touching. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 2/3 of the Ale
                Using your hands, mix the ingredients together. Gradually add the remaining 
                Ale (you may not need it all), until all the flour leaves the side of the 
                bowl and you have a soft, rough dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour a little oil onto a clean work surface. Sit the dough on the oil and 
                begin to knead. Do this for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth 
                and silky. Once the correct consistency is achieved, place the dough into a c
                lean, oiled bowl. Cover with cling film and leave in a warm place until tripled 
                in size (about 2 hours).
            </li>
            <li>
                Once risen, place the dough onto a floured surface. Knock the dough back by 
                folding it in on itself repeatedly. Do this until all the air is knocked out and 
                the dough is smooth.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Devide the dough into 14 equal piecesroll each piece of dough by rolling it in a 
                cage formed by your hand, moving your hand in circular motion rotating the ball 
                rapidly, place one ball in the centre of a parchment covered tray and surround 
                by 6 more almost touching   
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and leave to prove for 1-2 hours at room temperature, or until doubled in size   
            </li>
            <li>
                Dust with a little flour. Snip the tops with scissors for decoration 
                using a sharp knife across the top.   
            </li>  
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 210 C and place a baking tray filled with water on the 
                bottom shelf of the oven - this will create steam when the loaf is baking. Place 
                the loaf on the middle shelf and bake for 30 minutes until the rols are golden in 
                colour and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove from the oven and 
                leave to cool on a wire rack.
