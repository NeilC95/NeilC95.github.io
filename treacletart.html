                For the pastry case, sift the flour and salt into a food processor, 
                add the butter and lard, then whizz briefly until the mixture resembles 
                fine breadcrumbs. Add 1½-2 tbsp cold water and whizz again, very briefly, 
                using the pulse button, until the mixture starts to form clumps 
                (only add more water if it looks too dry), then turn out onto a lightly 
                floured surface and knead briefly until smooth. Roll out and use to line
                a 23cm x 3.5cm deep loose-bottomed flan tin. Prick the base here and there 
                with a fork, then chill for 20 minutes 
            </li>
            <li>
                Put a baking sheet into the oven and preheat it to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. 
                Line the pastry case with a crumpled sheet of baking paper and a layer of 
                baking beans/uncooked rice. (See our how to bake blind video below.) Put 
                the case onto the hot baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes until the 
                pastry edges are biscuit-coloured. Remove the baking paper and beans/rice, 
                then return it to the oven for 5-6 minutes or until the base of the case is 
                golden brown. Remove and lower the oven temperature to 170°C/fan150°C/gas 3½.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the breadcrumbs in a large mixing bowl. Stand the tin of golden syrup 
                in a pan of hot water to warm through and become runny, but don’t let it 
                get too hot. Weigh out the required amount into a saucepan and stir in 
                the lemon zest and lemon juice, followed by the beaten eggs and cream. 
                Drizzle the warm syrup mixture over the breadcrumbs and allow it to sink 
                in, giving a very gentle stir, if necessary, to incorporate all the 
                breadcrumbs (overmixing will give you a dense, chewy filling). Set to 
                one side for 5 minutes to allow the crumbs to swell slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture into the pastry case and evenly distribute the breadcrumbs 
                through the syrupy mixture. Bake for 45-50 minutes, turning the tin now and 
                then so it cooks evenly, until the filling is just set and golden brown 
                around the edges. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then transfer 
                to a serving plate and serve, cut into thin wedges, with some extra thick 
                double cream or ice cream.
