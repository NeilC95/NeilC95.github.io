                Method

        <div class="content_section_text">
          
          <ol class="olset">
                
            <li>
                Place the dry ingredients in a bowl, taking care not to have the salt and 
                yeast touching. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 2/3 of the water
                Using your hands, mix the ingredients together. Gradually add the remaining 
                water (you may not need it all), until all the flour leaves the side of the 
                bowl and you have a soft, rough dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour a little oil onto a clean work surface. Sit the dough on the oil and 
                begin to knead. Do this for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth 
                and silky. Once the correct consistency is achieved, place the dough into a c
                lean, oiled bowl. Cover with cling film and leave in a warm place until tripled 
                in size (about 2 hours).
            </li>
            <li>
                Once risen, place the dough onto a floured surface. Knock the dough back by 
                folding it in on itself repeatedly. Do this until all the air is knocked out and 
                the dough is smooth.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                To shape into the bloomer, flatten the dough into a rectangle. With the long side 
                facing you fold each end into the middle then roll like a Swiss roll so that you 
                have a smooth top with a seam along the base. Very gently roll with the heel of 
                your hands.   
            </li>
            <li>
                Place on a tray lined with parchment paper, cover and leave to prove for 1-2 hours 
                at room temperature, or until doubled in size   
            </li>
            <li>
                Lightly spray with water and dust with a little flour. Make four diagonal slashes 
                using a sharp knife across the top.   
            </li>  
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 220/425F/Gas 7 and place a baking tray filled with water on the 
                bottom shelf of the oven - this will create steam when the loaf is baking. Place 
                the loaf on the middle shelf and bake for 25 minutes. After this time lower the 
                heat to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and bake for a further 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and 
                leave to cool on a wire rack.   
            </li>
