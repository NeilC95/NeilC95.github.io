                Method

        <div class="content_section_text">
          
          <ol class="olset">
                
            <li>
                Top the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the salt, sugar and 
                cinnamon to one side of the bowl and the yeast to the other, add 
                the butter and 3/4 of the water and turn the mixture round with your 
                fingers, continue to add the water a little at a time until you have 
                picked up all the flour from the sides of the bowl, you may not need 
                all the water or you may need a little more, you want a dough that 
                is soft but not soggy, use the mixture to clean the inside of the bowl
                keep going until the mixture forms a rough dough
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat the worksurface with a little veg oil, then tip out the dough and 
                begin to knead, keep kneading for 5-10 mins, work through the initial 
                wet stage, until the dough starts to form a soft smooth skin
            </li>
            <li>
                When your dough feels smooth and silky, put it into a large lightly
                oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in
                size, at least one hour but fine to leave it for 2 or even 3 hours
            </li>
            <li>
                Line 2 backing trays with baking parchment or silicon paper
            </li>
            <li>
                Tip the sultanas and mixed peel on top of the risen dough in the bowl
                and start working them into it, after a minute or two, tip the dough out 
                onto a lightly floured surface and knead until the fruit is mixed in
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into 8 pieces, shape each into a ball, then use a rolling
                pin to flatten out each one into a round bun, about 1cm thick, brush
                the teacakes with beaten egg, transfer them to prepared baking trays
                spacing them apart
            </li>
            <li>
                Put each tray inside a clean plastic bag and leave to raise for about
                an hour until the teacakes have doubled in size, mean while heat the 
                oven to 200 C
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the teacakes for 10-15 mins until risen and golden, cool on wire 
                rack
            </li>
            
              
              
          </ol>
